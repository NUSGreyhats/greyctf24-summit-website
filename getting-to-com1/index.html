<p class="x">~ getting to COM1 by public transport (recommended!)</p>

<p>1. Take the MRT to Kent Ridge Station (circle line).</p>

<p>2. Exit from the station via Exit A.</p>

<p>3. Walk via the underpass to get to "Opposite Kent Ridge Station Exit A" bus stop.</p>

<p>4. Take Bus D2 until COM3. <i>(the bus will take longer since it is a weekend)</i></p>

<p>5. We have a video on how to walk to COM1 from the COM3 bus stop on our instagram!</p>
