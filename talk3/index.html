    <p>What factors should you consider, other than “the attack” in the development of android-based malware?</p>

    <p class="x">~ talk sypnosis</p>

    <p>Frequently, when developing malware or malicious software, we tend to concentrate solely on exploiting
    vulnerabilities. However, what other factors should be taken into account in this process?</p>

    <p>Drawing from my publication, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626232.3658638">"A-COPILOT: Android Covert
      Operation for Private Information Lifting and OTP Theft"</a>, this discussion will explore the importance of considering factors such as stealthiness and obfuscation.</p>
