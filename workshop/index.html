With the rise of buzzwords like Web3, blockchain, smart contracts, and NFTs, have you ever
wondered what the technology behind them is and how it works?

In this workshop, we'll explore how the blockchain (or more specifically, Smart Contracts)
functions and how we can interact with it.

Finally, we'll explore some common vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts that hackers may
exploit to access large sums of money.
