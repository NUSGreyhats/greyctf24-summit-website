    <p>With the rise of buzzwords like Web3, blockchain, smart contracts, and NFTs, have you ever
    wondered what the technology behind them is and how it works?</p>

    <p>In this workshop, we'll explore how the blockchain (or more specifically, Smart Contracts)
    functions and how we can interact with it.</p>

    <p>Finally, we'll explore some common vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts that hackers may
    exploit to access large sums of money.</p>
