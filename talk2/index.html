How CTF-type skills will be useful in a Cybersecurity career?


<x>~ talk sypnosis</x>

In this presentation, we explore how the skills honed through Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions can
pave the way for a successful career in security research.

CTFs are competitive events that challenge participants to solve complex cybersecurity problems,
fostering a deep understanding of various security concepts.

We will examine the differences between playing CTFs and real world cybersecurity research and how
aspiring security researchers can build a strong foundation for their careers.
